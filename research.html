          <p><b>Abstract.</b>
            Using data from the Chicago Police Department on complaints filed by civilians and reports of force by
            officers, this paper estimates the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) of officer and civilian behavior.
            Using a two-way fixed effects design, I find BWCs are associated with a 33% reduction in use-of-force
            complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints.
            Additionally, I find a 42% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less
            significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints.
            Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians.
            However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC adoption.

          <p><b>Abstract.</b>
            Gun buyback programs (GBPs), which use public funds to purchase civilians' privately-owned
            firearms, aim to reduce gun violence. However, next to nothing is known about their effects on
            firearm-related crime or deaths. Using data from the National Incident Based Reporting System,
            we find no evidence that GBPs reduce gun crime. Given our estimated null findings, with 95
            percent confidence, we can rule out decreases in firearm-related crime of greater than 1.3 percent
            during the year following a buyback. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, we
            also find no evidence that GBPs reduce suicides or homicides where a firearm was involved.
            These results call into question the efficacy of city gun buyback programs in their current form.
