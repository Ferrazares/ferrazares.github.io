            <p>Using data from the Chicago Police Department on complaints filed by civilians and reports of force by officers, this paper estimates the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) on officer and civilian behavior. Using a two-way fixed effects design, I find BWCs are associated with a 33% reduction in use-of-force complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints. Additionally, I find a 42% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints. Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians. However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC adoption.</p>

            <p>Decision-making, risk-taking, and situational awareness are all important factors for effective and equitable policing. However, these factors can also be affected by fatigue, overwork, and cognitive stress, which can accumulate as police officers continue to work. This paper studies how working consecutive days affects police officer outcomes and decision-making using data from the Chicago Police Department. To deal with potential selection of working days, I leverage arbitrarily-assigned fixed schedules as well as a two-way fixed effects design that uses both within-officer and within-assignment variation. I find that, after initially increasing, officers make fewer arrests, conduct fewer stops, patrol less, and are more likely to be injured as they work more days. The declines in activity are driven by reductions towards the end of an officer's shift. Fatigue, inexperience, and cognitive stress all contribute as mechanisms for a reduction in activity with several alternative mechanisms explored. Despite this decline in arrests, officers file more use-of-force reports after working many consecutive days.</p>
