        <p><b>Abstract.</b>
          Using data from the Chicago Police Department on complaints filed by civilians and reports of force by
          officers, this paper estimates the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) of officer and civilian behavior.
          Using a two-way fixed effects design, I find BWCs are associated with a 33% reduction in use-of-force
          complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints.
          Additionally, I find a 42% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less
          significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints.
          Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians.
          However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC adoption.

        <p><b>Abstract.</b>
          Gun buyback programs (GBPs), which use public funds to purchase civilians' privately-owned
          firearms, aim to reduce gun violence. However, next to nothing is known about their effects on
          firearm-related crime or deaths. Using data from the National Incident Based Reporting System,
          we find no evidence that GBPs reduce gun crime. Given our estimated null findings, with 95
          percent confidence, we can rule out decreases in firearm-related crime of greater than 1.3 percent
          during the year following a buyback. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, we
          also find no evidence that GBPs reduce suicides or homicides where a firearm was involved.
          These results call into question the efficacy of city gun buyback programs in their current form.

        <p><b>Abstract.</b>
          Decision-making, risk-taking, and situational awareness are all important factors for effective and
          equitable policing.
          However, these factors can also can be affected by sleep and fatigue.
          In this paper I study how working consecutive days affects officer arrests, use-of-force, dispatch response
          times, and other outcomes using data from the Chicago Police Department.
          To deal with potential selection of working days, I leverage arbitrarily-assigned fixed schedules as well as
          a two-way fixed effects design that uses both within-officer and within-assignment variation.
          I find that officers make fewer arrests and conduct fewer stops as they work more days.
          <!-- Conversely, day-shift officers see modest increases in arrests per day worked, indicating returns from the
            continuity of work. -->
          <!-- Fatigue and sleep loss are the most likely mechanism for the difference between night- and day-shift -->
          <!-- officers. -->
          These changes persist as officers gain experience and are present in both high-crime and low-crime areas.
          Despite a large decline in arrests, officers file more use-of-force reports after working 4
          consecutive days.
          <!-- Night-shift officers (but not day-shift officers) also see a reduction in arrests per stop, citations per
            stop, and an increase in use-of-force per arrest. -->

            ShotSpotter Technology on Police Response Times</a>", with Michael Topper
          <br>
        </p>

        <p><b>Abstract.</b>
          ShotSpotter is an acoustic gunfire detection technology utilized by police departments in over 150 cities
          with the intention of rapidly dispatching police officers to violent crime scenes to catch perpetrators and
          reduce gun violence. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its effectiveness in reducing gun
          violence (intended consequence) nor its effect on 911 emergency response times (unintended consequence)
          given its resource-intensive operating procedures. In this paper, we utilize variation in timing from
          ShotSpotter roll-outs across Chicago police districts from 2016-2022 to estimate the causal effects of
          ShotSpotter on 911 emergency response times that are designated as Priority 1 (immediate dispatch). Using
          comprehensive 911 dispatch data from the Chicago Police Department, we find that ShotSpotter leads police
          officers to be dispatched one-minute slower (23% increase) and arrive on-scene two-minutes later (14%
          increase) while controlling for the police officer availability and overall 911 call quantities. Moreover,
          these effects are driven by resource-constrained periods, and consequently, reduce police officers' success
          rate in arresting perpetrators (12%) when responding to emergency calls. However, we also find that
          ShotSpotter increases the number of gun-related arrests, thereby indicating success in achieving its primary
          goal, albeit at a significant cost.
