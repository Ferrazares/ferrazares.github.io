          <p><b>Abstract.</b>
            Using data from the Chicago Police Department on complaints filed by civilians and reports of force by
            officers, this paper estimates the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) of officer and civilian behavior.
            Using a two-way fixed effects design, I find BWCs are associated with a 33% reduction in use-of-force
            complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints.
            Additionally, I find a 42% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less
            significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints.
            Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians.
            However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC adoption.

          <p><b>Abstract.</b>
            Gun buyback programs (GBPs), which use public funds to purchase civilians' privately-owned
            firearms, aim to reduce gun violence. However, next to nothing is known about their effects on
            firearm-related crime or deaths. Using data from the National Incident Based Reporting System,
            we find no evidence that GBPs reduce gun crime. Given our estimated null findings, with 95
            percent confidence, we can rule out decreases in firearm-related crime of greater than 1.3 percent
            during the year following a buyback. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, we
            also find no evidence that GBPs reduce suicides or homicides where a firearm was involved.
            These results call into question the efficacy of city gun buyback programs in their current form.

              ShotSpotter Technology on Police Response Times</a>", with Michael Topper
            <br>
          </p>

          <p><b>Abstract.</b>
            ShotSpotter is an acoustic gunfire detection technology utilized by police departments in over 150 cities
            with the intention of rapidly dispatching police officers to violent crime scenes to catch perpetrators and
            reduce gun violence. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its effectiveness in reducing gun
            violence (intended consequence) nor its effect on 911 emergency response times (unintended consequence)
            given its resource-intensive operating procedures. In this paper, we utilize variation in timing from
            ShotSpotter roll-outs across Chicago police districts from 2016-2022 to estimate the causal effects of
            ShotSpotter on 911 emergency response times that are designated as Priority 1 (immediate dispatch). Using
            comprehensive 911 dispatch data from the Chicago Police Department, we find that ShotSpotter leads police
            officers to be dispatched one-minute slower (23% increase) and arrive on-scene two-minutes later (14%
            increase) while controlling for the police officer availability and overall 911 call quantities. Moreover,
            these effects are driven by resource-constrained periods, and consequently, reduce police officers' success
            rate in arresting perpetrators (12%) when responding to emergency calls. However, we also find that
            ShotSpotter increases the number of gun-related arrests, thereby indicating success in achieving its primary
            goal, albeit at a significant cost.
