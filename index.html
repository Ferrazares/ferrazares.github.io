      <p>
        Toshio Ferrazares is a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of California, Santa
        Barbara. His research focuses broadly on Public and Labor Economics with a primary interest in the economics of
        policing and public safety. He investigates how various factors influence police officer behavior and community
        outcomes. <br><br>

        His job market paper explores the effects of fatigue and overwork on police officers. This paper finds that
        increased fatigue leads to higher instances of use-of-force, more officer injuries, and unnecessary arrests,
        while simultaneously reducing productive activities such as patrolling, investigatory stops, and timely 911
        dispatching. These findings highlight the significant costs of overwork in policing and inform policy
        discussions aimed at improving officer well-being and public safety. <br><br>

        Toshio’s solo-authored research has been published in top field journals such as the <i>Journal of Urban
          Economics</i> and was honored with the "Best Second Year Paper" award by UCSB. Prior to his doctoral studies,
        he earned both a B.A. and M.A. in Economics from San Diego State University. <br><br>

            <p>Using data from the Chicago Police Department on complaints filed by civilians and reports of force by
              officers, this paper estimates the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) of officer and civilian behavior.
              Using a two-way fixed effects design, I find BWCs are associated with a 33% reduction in use-of-force
              complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints.
              Additionally, I find a 42% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less
              significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints.
              Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians.
              However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC
              adoption.

              Decision-making, risk-taking, and situational awareness are all important factors for effective and
              equitable policing.
              However, these factors can also be affected by fatigue, overwork, and cognitive stress, which can
              accumulate as police officers continue to work.
              This paper studies how working consecutive days affects police officer outcomes and activity using rich
              data from the Chicago Police Department.
              To overcome the endogenous selection of working days, I take advantage of a unique shift structure where
              working days are predetermined and based on fixed groupings.
              This is combined with a two-way fixed effects design that leverages within-officer and within-assignment
              variation.
              I find that, after initially increasing, officers make fewer arrests, conduct fewer stops, issue fewer
              citations and tickets, and patrol less as they work more days.
              The declines in activity are driven by reductions towards the end of an officer’s shift.
              Despite this decline in arrests and activity, officers file more use-of-force reports, are more likely to
              be injured, and make more judgement-based discretionary arrests after working many consecutive days.

            <p>ShotSpotter is an acoustic gunfire detection technology utilized by police departments in over 150 cities
              with the intention of rapidly dispatching police officers to violent crime scenes to catch perpetrators
              and
              reduce gun violence. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its effectiveness in reducing gun
              violence (intended consequence) nor its effect on 911 emergency response times (unintended consequence)
              given its resource-intensive operating procedures. In this paper, we utilize variation in timing from
              ShotSpotter roll-outs across Chicago police districts from 2016-2022 to estimate the causal effects of
              ShotSpotter on 911 emergency response times that are designated as Priority 1 (immediate dispatch). Using
              comprehensive 911 dispatch data from the Chicago Police Department, we find that ShotSpotter leads police
              officers to be dispatched one-minute slower (23% increase) and arrive on-scene two-minutes later (14%
              increase) while controlling for the police officer availability and overall 911 call quantities. Moreover,
              these effects are driven by resource-constrained periods, and consequently, reduce police officers'
              success
              rate in arresting perpetrators (12%) when responding to emergency calls. However, we also find that
              ShotSpotter increases the number of gun-related arrests, thereby indicating success in achieving its
              primary
              goal, albeit at a significant cost.

            <p>Gun buyback programs (GBPs), which use public funds to purchase civilians' privately-owned
              firearms, aim to reduce gun violence. However, next to nothing is known about their effects on
              firearm-related crime or deaths. Using data from the National Incident Based Reporting System,
              we find no evidence that GBPs reduce gun crime. Given our estimated null findings, with 95
              percent confidence, we can rule out decreases in firearm-related crime of greater than 1.3 percent
              during the year following a buyback. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, we
              also find no evidence that GBPs reduce suicides or homicides where a firearm was involved.
              These results call into question the efficacy of city gun buyback programs in their current form.
