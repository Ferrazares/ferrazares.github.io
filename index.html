            <p>Using data from the Chicago Police Department on complaints filed by civilians and reports of force by
              officers, this paper estimates the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) of officer and civilian behavior.
              Using a two-way fixed effects design, I find BWCs are associated with a 33% reduction in use-of-force
              complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints.
              Additionally, I find a 42% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less
              significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints.
              Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians.
              However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC
              adoption.

            <p>Decision-making, risk-taking, and situational awareness are all important factors for effective and
              equitable policing.
              However, these factors can also be affected by fatigue, overwork, and cognitive stress, which can
              accumulate as police officers continue to work.
              This paper studies how working consecutive days affects police officer outcomes and decision-making using
              data from the Chicago Police Department.
              To deal with potential selection of working days, I leverage arbitrarily-assigned fixed schedules as well
              as a two-way fixed effects design that uses both within-officer and within-assignment variation.
              I find that, after initially increasing, officers make fewer arrests, conduct fewer stops, patrol less,
              and are more likely to be injured as they work more days.
              The declines in activity are driven by reductions towards the end of an officer's shift.
              Fatigue, inexperience, and cognitive stress all contribute as mechanisms for a reduction in activity with
              several alternative mechanisms explored.
              Despite this decline in arrests, officers file more use-of-force reports after working many consecutive
              days.

              <p>Gun buyback programs (GBPs), which use public funds to purchase civilians' privately-owned
              firearms, aim to reduce gun violence. However, next to nothing is known about their effects on
              firearm-related crime or deaths. Using data from the National Incident Based Reporting System,
              we find no evidence that GBPs reduce gun crime. Given our estimated null findings, with 95
              percent confidence, we can rule out decreases in firearm-related crime of greater than 1.3 percent
              during the year following a buyback. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, we
              also find no evidence that GBPs reduce suicides or homicides where a firearm was involved.
              These results call into question the efficacy of city gun buyback programs in their current form.

          <div class="content">
            <p>ShotSpotter is an acoustic gunfire detection technology utilized by police departments in over 150 cities
              with the intention of rapidly dispatching police officers to violent crime scenes to catch perpetrators
              and
              reduce gun violence. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its effectiveness in reducing gun
              violence (intended consequence) nor its effect on 911 emergency response times (unintended consequence)
              given its resource-intensive operating procedures. In this paper, we utilize variation in timing from
              ShotSpotter roll-outs across Chicago police districts from 2016-2022 to estimate the causal effects of
              ShotSpotter on 911 emergency response times that are designated as Priority 1 (immediate dispatch). Using
              comprehensive 911 dispatch data from the Chicago Police Department, we find that ShotSpotter leads police
              officers to be dispatched one-minute slower (23% increase) and arrive on-scene two-minutes later (14%
              increase) while controlling for the police officer availability and overall 911 call quantities. Moreover,
              these effects are driven by resource-constrained periods, and consequently, reduce police officers'
              success
              rate in arresting perpetrators (12%) when responding to emergency calls. However, we also find that
              ShotSpotter increases the number of gun-related arrests, thereby indicating success in achieving its
              primary
              goal, albeit at a significant cost.
